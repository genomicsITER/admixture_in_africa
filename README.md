# Admixture into and within Sub-Saharan Africa


![African populations](figures/MalariaGenMAPofPops.png)

## Summary
This code relates to analyses and figures generated for our paper, _Admixture into and within sub-Saharan Africa_ published in eLife, which can be downloaded [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15266 "Admixture into and within sub-Saharan Africa")

I've put various pieces of code in this repository, mostly to do with work on admixture and natural selection with a pan-African dataset. It is highly likely that there are some bugs in this code, so let me know if you're interested in using the code and you run into problems


## Overview of file system

### data/
various files containing the baseline data used for plotting

### figures/
contains figures generated from plotting_scripts

### packages_dev/
a directory of package(s) where I have started to store useful functions (mostly for plotting)

### packages_ext/
external libraries that I use, for example, Dan Lawson's library for editing fineSTRUCTURE output

### plotting_scripts/
code to make plots for what will be final paper figures
