## Summary
I've put various pieces of code in this repository, mostly to do with work on admixture and natural selection with a pan-African dataset.


## Overview of file system

### data/
various files containing the baseline data used for plotting

### data_scripts/
scripts for changing data formats

### figures/
contains figures generated from plotting_scripts

### natural_selection/
code for our local ancestry based natural selection software and associated helper programs

### packages_dev/
a directory of package(s) where I have started to store useful functions (mostly for plotting)

### packages_ext/
external libraries that I use, for example, Dan Lawson's library for editing fineSTRUCTURE output

### painting/
scripts to run chromosome painting

### plotting_scripts/
code to make plots for what will be final paper figures

Please contact me if you are interested in any of this code BEFORE forking / downloading. Many thanks.
