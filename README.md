# popgen

## Overview of file system
I've put various pieces of code in this repository, mostly to do with work on admixture and natural selections with the MalariaGEN dataset.

plotting_scripts = code to make plots for what will be final paper figures
data = various files containing the baseline data used for plotting
natural_selection = code for our local ancestry based natural selection software and associated helper programs
packages_dev = a directory of package(s) where I have started to store useful functions (mostly for plotting)
packages_ext = external libraries that I use, for example, Dan Lawson's library for editing fineSTRUCTURE output

Please contact me if you are interested in any of this code BEFORE forking / downloading. Many thanks.
