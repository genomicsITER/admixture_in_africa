# Admixture into and within Sub-Saharan Africa


<img src="figures/MalariaGenMAPofPops.png" width="500" title="African populations used in study">

## Summary
This code relates to analyses and figures generated for our paper, _Admixture into and within sub-Saharan Africa_ published in eLife, which can be downloaded [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15266 "Admixture into and within sub-Saharan Africa")

I've put various pieces of code in this repository, mostly to do with work on admixture in the pan-African dataset used in the paper above. I haven't provided much help on usage, I'm afraid, although the plotting code is reasonably straightforward. It is highly likely that there are bugs, so let me know if you're interested in using anything and you run into problems


## Overview of file system

### data/
various files containing the baseline data used for plotting

### figures/
contains figures generated from plotting_scripts

### packages_dev/
a directory of package(s) where I have started to store useful functions (mostly for plotting)

### packages_ext/
external libraries that I use, for example, Dan Lawson's library for editing fineSTRUCTURE output

### plotting_scripts/
code to make plots for what will be final paper figures
